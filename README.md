# Solution approach

To plan my approach to the challenge, I conducted research on specific industry-related knowledge to meet the test requirements. I hope the information I gathered is accurate, and the solution correctly fulfills the specified requirements.

Given more time, I would have implemented additional tests and organized the CSS files into separate files, placing them in folders according to the components that utilize them. Additionally, I would have improved the overall styling, ensuring responsiveness. I also would have dedicated more attention on refining the chart to effectively display the data.
And one last thing I would have done given more time is also to display more information though a breakdown to give the user a better understanding of the displayed data.
